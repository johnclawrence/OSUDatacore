This folder contains my work on scientific replication.
The short short short version of this work is...
Lots of science isn't replicateable
Even if it is replicateable it's old
Despite this we still use flawed and old science to make real world decisions. 

Science that uses secondary datasets for their findings should behave as functions.
Replication work is to determine if a study behaves as a function- given a consistent input you get the same output.
If a study is a function not only can it be automatically replicated, it can be automatically expanded as secondary datasets have consistent datastructures from year to year.
Furthermore my research focuses on medical claims data because, broadly, all medical claims data, everywhere, contains the same field formated in the same way, and claims data has consistently good datastructure as it is coded before sent to insurers. 

This is my vision for a future approach to how science can be performed and it is my sincere hope that my work here will transform the way that science that uses secondary data for its findings is performed and validated.
My work is inspired by the writings of Dr Eric Ford and the wisdom and mentorship of Dr Timothy Huerta.
