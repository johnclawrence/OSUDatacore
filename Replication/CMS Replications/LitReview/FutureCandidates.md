    this is an option but I don't know how to do the analysis... but maybe =)

So to summarize from my lit review...

Papers that look straight forward
Paper-01#126    Older adult visits to the emergency department for ambulatory care sensitive conditions.
                    This paper has some very serious internal consistency isues but is the paper that I ultimately picked for paper 1. 
Paper-02#777    Problematic Risk Adjustment in National Healthcare Safety Network Measures.
                    This paper uses the calculated variable APR-DRG but beyond that it is fairly straight forward.
Paper-05#463    Does primary care diabetes management provided to Medicare patients differ between primary care physicians and nurse practitioners?
                    So this paper uses 2012 SAF data... but based on the 5% sample. And I have the 100% sample, and as it turns out, there is no way to GET the 5% sample from the 100% sample... So do I can I can do this exactly? No. But I can probably do it pretty close. https://
Paper-08#37     Comparative Effectiveness of New Approaches to Improve Mortality Risk Models From Medicare Claims Data.
                    This is probably a hit. It depends on to what extent I can re-implmement thier models but I would be suprised if I can't atleast build their dataset.
Paper-09#83     Development and Testing of Improved Models to Predict Payment Using Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Claims Data.
                    This is basically the same idea as 37, with the same potential limitations... honestly this might literally be the same paper? But I don't know until I dig further in.
Paper-10#91     Hot spotting surgical patients undergoing hepatopancreatic procedures.
                    Seeing as how this one was literally done at my institution by a professer I know on a DUA that I'm on, I feel comfy that fufills my criteria. 
Paper-15#1193   A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Comparing Single-use and Traditional Negative Pressure Wound Therapy to Treat Chronic Venous and Diabetic Foot Ulcers.
                    This paper is using markov chains, and those are converging but not deterministic. 
                    This paper could be excluded because it is non-deterministic.            




Paper-16#960    Association of Ambulatory Hemodynamic Monitoring of Heart Failure With Clinical Outcomes in a Concurrent Matched Cohort Analysis.
                    This paper uses CMS as a control, It's not a -good- candidate, but it's possible. 
                    This paper could be excluded because it references local EMR data.




Excluded
Paper-03#666    County-Level Socioeconomic Disparities in Use of Medical Services for Management of Infections by Medicare Beneficiaries With Diabetes-United States, 2012.
                    This paper uses 2012's AHRF, and I need to decide if this is soemthing I want to deal with. This dataset when it was sent to me was un-useable. I will be waiting to see if I get a better paper before doing this.
Paper-04#1003   Association Between Initiation of Pulmonary Rehabilitation After Hospitalization for COPD and 1-Year Survival Among Medicare Beneficiaries
                    Again, this looks like a win; however, it might also be using the RIF This was infact RIF.
Paper-06#377    The cost impact to Medicare of shifting treatment of worsening heart failure from inpatient to outpatient management settings.
                    They use their internal healthcare encounters to establish a baseline. I can't believe I missed this. 
Paper-07#529    Hospitalizations for ambulatory care sensitive conditions and unplanned readmissions among Medicare beneficiaries with Alzheimer's disease.
                    It starts in 2013 but uses the CCW so my cohort number is going to be off because I don't have 4 years of data
Paper-11#146    Association Between Postoperative Pneumonia and 90-Day Episode Payments and Outcomes Among Medicare Beneficiaries Undergoing Cardiac Surgery.
                    This looks doable but it might use Medpar and not SAF and I can't tell that until I get into it,
                    It uses DME. 
Paper-12#53     Development and Validation of an Administrative Claims-based Measure for All-cause 30-day Risk-standardized Readmissions After Discharge From Inpatient Psychiatric Facilities.
                Paper uses IPF-PPS and I do not have that dataset.
Paper-13#841    Variation in Facility-Level Rates of All-Cause and Potentially Preventable 30-Day Hospital Readmissions Among Medicare Fee-for-Service Beneficiaries After Discharge From Postacute Inpatient Rehabilitation.
                Uses the Medicare Provider Analysis and Review, which I do not have.
Paper-14#466    Trends in health service use and potentially avoidable hospitalizations before Alzheimer's disease diagnosis: A matched, retrospective study of US Medicare beneficiaries
                Should have been elimited for early too early.
