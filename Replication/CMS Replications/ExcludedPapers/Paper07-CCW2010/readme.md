Paper-07#529    Hospitalizations for ambulatory care sensitive conditions and unplanned readmissions among Medicare beneficiaries with Alzheimer's disease.
                    It starts in 2013 but uses the CCW so my cohort number is going to be off because I don't have 4 years of data

So here is the rub... My definition of AHRD is going to be different than CCW, I can only look back 1 year, CCW looks back three. So Their cohort is one that I cannot truely replicate because it uses data from before 2012. (As late as 2010)
So for that reason it's excluded.
