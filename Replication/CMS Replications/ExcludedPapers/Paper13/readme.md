 So, onto the methods!
 This is a retrospective cohort study of Medicare claims data that included 1162 IRFs submitting claims to CMS. 
    Yep, it's the dataset.
 We used the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guidelines to guide the study analyses and reporting. '
    I'm not sure what STROBE is yet, but hopefully it isn't some other dataset that prevents me from actually using this paper.
All analyses were completed after establishing a data use agreement with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and obtaining approval from the institutional review board of the University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, which waived the need for informed consent for use of deidentified data from publicly available files.
    So LDF/SAF and not RIF, that's a good start. 

Data Sources
Data were obtained from the Medicare Provider Analysis and Review, 
    I don't know what this is...
Medicare Beneficiary Summary, 
    Yep
Medicare IRF-Patient Assessment Instrument, 
    I don't know what this is either...    
and Medicare Provider of Service. 
    This is using another dataset isn't it...
inpatient rehabilitation facilities = IRF

The Medicare Provider Analysis and Review files contain final claims for stays in IRFs, acute care hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and psychiatric hospitals. 
    Oh no, this is a bad start. Psychiatric hospitls are something I know I can't identify...

We used these files to gather information about patientsâ€™ prior hospitalizations, verify their IRF stays, and identify readmissions within the 30-day window after their IRF stay. 
    Yeap I don't have that file... That's a different dataset I don't have. 
    
Medicare Beneficiary Summary files were used to gather Medicare enrollment information. We also used Medicare Beneficiary Summary files to identify patients who died within the 30-day period after their IRF stay. Files were linked using unique, encrypted identifiers.
