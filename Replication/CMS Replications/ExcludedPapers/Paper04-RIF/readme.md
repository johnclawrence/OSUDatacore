Methods
    Retrospective cohort study of all fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries older than 65 years who were hospitalized for COPD in 2014, with a final date of follow-up of December 31, 2015,
        cohort using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, https://cdn.jamanetwork.com/ama/content_public/journal/jama/938468/joi200034supp1_prod.pdf?Expires=1646909213&Signature=i18ck2fDko0Q2gx~J-bNVdm0V02ml88z1m8QymvtDQ3TNwQbav-DV4zjflfNCm2dRwfLERVQaWHOG9RwJHqApOS8thJJ-vCzTrGBCAIRBJ2Uv~cjGTumk5jnI3Hr5~xKX4kZT-~YK1zXB~i5zDDfGchp9-erUVEC5J9eIL~i7W8SOFZeAOu995cVrLhvzPN~ebxIiMDu~~4zw9ayKpbHLzo3FjRsHr3C~jofNYK4JZ4vjjvvh1xs-8xH-RBTDIjK~qJ~CQ4o~-P4K6oCQxKAxY5NPKqlGUNZvXsMVnlY3VQsa0QfzRQrwnaZDQFXpEB7Ta9Eoy4kvmEvp~b5opLRIQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA

        first hospitalization in the year as the index hospitalization.
        excluded beneficiaries who had received pulmonary rehabilitation during the previous year.
        excluded patients with dementia, metastatic cancer, and acute myocardial infarction/acute coronary syndrome
        excluded patients  unlikely to initiate pulmonary rehabilitation within 90 days of discharge and to have a high risk of mortality
            These included patients with an index hospital stay longer than 31 days, those transferred to another acute care hospital, individuals discharged to skilled nursing facilities who remained in the facility for more than 30 days, and individuals who died within 30 days of discharge (Process explained in Figure 1, Woot Figure 1.)
        
        Medicare outpatient and carrier files to identify patients who received pulmonary rehabilitation, using common procedure coding system codes G0424 (COPD-specific pulmonary rehabilitation) and G0237, G0238, and G0239 (nonspecific pulmonary rehabilitation).
            Sociodemographic characteristics included age, sex, race/ethnicity, Medicaid dual eligibility (a proxy for lower socioeconomic status), current tobacco use, and distance to the nearest pulmonary rehabilitation facility.
                uh-oh. Neared PRF implies some geographic data... This might be RIF...
            an algorithm to assign beneficiaries to Hispanic or Asian based on last name
                They have last name. This is using the RIF. I cannot reproduce this.
