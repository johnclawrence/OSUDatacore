This study was conducted using deidentified administrative claims data from the Standard Analytical Files for a 5% random sample of Medicare beneficiaries. The data span the years 1999â€“2014 and include information on Medicare enrollment history, patient demographics, and detailed medical claims including diagnosis codes, procedure codes, place of service (e.g., hospital, physician office), dates of service (year and quarter; precise dates available from 2009 onwards), provider type, provider specialty, and associated payments made by Medicare to providers. However, the data do not include Medicare Part D (i.e., prescription drug) claims.

Huh... how did this one not get eliminated earlier... did I not read 1999 as the start date.
