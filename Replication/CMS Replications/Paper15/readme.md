Decision-analytic models are widely used to determine the cost-effectiveness of 1 treatment or health care program compared with another. The authors constructed a 2-state Markov model similar to that used by Romanelli et al20 in a cost-effectiveness analysis of extracellular matrix versus standard care for the treatment of VLUs. The model was implemented using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation). 

So, issue 1 is here. Markov is non deterministic, so we should get different answers every time we execute it, ish... That said, it should converge to a distrobution. .. that said I wonder if that's really the issue with this paper. 

 using US national Medicare claims data, assuming 2016 Medicare rates. Their analysis included claims data from Medicare Parts A and B over a wide range of health care settings and services. These unit costs were inflated to 2018 costs using health care inflation indices (US Bureau of Labor Statistics24) and multiplied by 7 to estimate the weekly costs of treatment for sNPWT and tNPWT (see Table 1).

That's like... it... huh... I can't eliminate this but they just, uh, did they just throw the whole database at this with no modification? I guess I can do that too. Weird. Well, I guess I can see what happens!
