Decision-analytic models are widely used to determine the cost-effectiveness of 1 treatment or health care program compared with another. The authors constructed a 2-state Markov model similar to that used by Romanelli et al20 in a cost-effectiveness analysis of extracellular matrix versus standard care for the treatment of VLUs. The model was implemented using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation). 

So, issue 1 is here. Markov is non deterministic, so we should get different answers every time we execute it, ish... That said, it should converge to a distrobution. .. that said I wonder if that's really the issue with this paper. 

 using US national Medicare claims data, assuming 2016 Medicare rates. Their analysis included claims data from Medicare Parts A and B over a wide range of health care settings and services. These unit costs were inflated to 2018 costs using health care inflation indices (US Bureau of Labor Statistics24) and multiplied by 7 to estimate the weekly costs of treatment for sNPWT and tNPWT (see Table 1).

That's like... it... huh... I can't eliminate this but they just, uh, did they just throw the whole database at this with no modification? I guess I can do that too. Weird. Well, I guess I can see what happens!

Two (2) arms of the model, tNPWT and sNPWT, were calculated separately for a combination of both VLU and DFU ulcer types in the proportions reported by Kirsner et al19 (37.3% DFU). The model assumptions are shown in Table 1. Open ulcer to closed ulcer transition probabilities were calculated using ulcer closure rates reported from the recent 161-patient RCT.19,23 Ulcer recurrence was not included in the model; therefore, the transition probability for closed ulcer to open ulcer was set to zero. Delhougne et al22 recently estimated the cost per day for sNPWT and tNPWT from the payer perspective using US national Medicare claims data, assuming 2016 Medicare rates. Their analysis included claims data from Medicare Parts A and B over a wide range of health care settings and services. These unit costs were inflated to 2018 costs using health care inflation indices (US Bureau of Labor Statistics24) and multiplied by 7 to estimate the weekly costs of treatment for sNPWT and tNPWT (see Table 1).

The costs over the defined timescale were summed to give a total cost of treatment for each arm of the model. The difference (the incremental cost) was calculated as the total cost for sNPWT minus the total cost for tNPWT. Effectiveness was calculated 2 ways: 1) the incidence of healing at a defined point (eg, 12 or 26 weeks), and 2) the total number of open ulcer weeks. The incremental effectiveness was calculated as sNPWT effectiveness minus tNPWT effectiveness.

The analysis described, using point values of all the model inputs, is known as the base case analysis. Further analyses were subsequently performed to investigate the sensitivity of the model to the input parameters and to develop an understanding of the uncertainty in the results. The base case analysis included results at 12 weeks (the timescale of the study by Kirsner et al19) and extended to 26 weeks.

huh... the paper doesn't actually have citations... weird.
