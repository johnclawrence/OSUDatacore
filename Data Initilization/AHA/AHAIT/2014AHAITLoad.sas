Description: 
This Code loads a MODIFIED version of the AHAIT dataset from the Excel Sheets.
It's modified because Row 2 is deleted. Row 2 contains survey names of data
but not database names. So Q1_2 is different between years but CSOFT is forever.
Unless it's not. BEcause AHA sometimes changes category values between years....
But that's a problem for future John Lawrence.
